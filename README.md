 # Odin-recipes mini project

 <em>Initial Motivations</em>
 
 <p>To start off with a very small project that will allow me to practice basic HTML, Git basics, and basic web design principles. 
 </p>

 <em>Post self reflection</em>

 <p>Off of just my intial motivations this mini project went fairly well. I was able to get experience with the structure and syntax of basic HTML by creating a simple static recipe website.
 </p>

 <p>Initially learning about the basics of git, the content was extremely abstract. However, overtime throught this project I was able to more clearly understand the nuances behind common git commands which changed my development approach as the project went on to accomodate brest practices. For example, I started clearly labeling my commits with intetion and making sure to keep them compartemntalized. That way I or anyone else would be able to understand each section more easily.
 </p>

 <p>For web design principles I was able to familiarize myself with the development process and begin to think about how I would do things differently with projects in the future. Part of my self reflection process involved looking at other student projects after the fact. It's interesting to see the small differences even in a such a small project like this one. For example, I saw someone include a retun to the top functionality at the bottom of their webpage which I thought was pretty neat and is something I'm looking to include in future projects.
